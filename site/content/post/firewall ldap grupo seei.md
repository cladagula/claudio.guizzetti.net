description = "The implementation of the firewall in the seei group was carried out in such a way that all the services of the company. were managed on a single server. 6 companies in different floors of the same tower were integrating SAP in their business model, so they needed internal interconnectivity, and that the resources of each company were not shared. so they were placed a firewall (software), where he managed the Internet connections of each company in one place (8 WANS) 6 VLANS. and we installed a new LDAP, with group policies to limit the users of the company. Bandwidth control was implemented. fail over, captive portal for wifi, bginfo in the LDAP, many more features."
