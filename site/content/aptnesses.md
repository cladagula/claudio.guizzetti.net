Through time and experience, each of the skills that I have developed is those that define what I am as a person, personally and professionally, and sometimes it is difficult to know which are the most important skills, but I can certainly name four that for me are the ones that I have most present in me.

INITIATIVE CAPACITY

* When I decided to be an entrepreneur, it was the moment when I realized that my initiative was to grow as a professional and develop as an entrepreneur. Throughout the more than 10 years that I have been an entrepreneur. I have understood that whenever you want to stand out from the rest, you must think Outside of the Box. The initiatives are born in me from the solution of problems in the best way and faster, and of course the most economic way for the final client.

ADAPTABILITY.

* In my opinion, the basic element to be a successful professional is the ability to adapt. Knowing how to adapt to the environment and make the most of it makes the difference between success and failure.

* Once a colleague told me the following sentence:

>The opportunist sees the opportunity in the calamity, the pessimist sees the calamity in the opportunity.

ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.

* When you start a company, and you have employees under your charge, you have a great responsibility under your shoulders. As manager and person. Every day is a continuous challenge to solve problems. And always find the best way to keep the customer happy. Even if that means losing money. But fulfilling the word is very important in the business world.

LEADERSHIP.

* The leadership of each person varies as much as their personality, my projection of being a leader, is to make every person that works by your side. Either partner or employee. Make him feel important, give value to his work. And if you can teach him something he does not know. You must do it because it is your duty as a leader. To take the lead and help your team or company take it to success.
